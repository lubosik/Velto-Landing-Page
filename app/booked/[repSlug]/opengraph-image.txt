OG Image Instructions
=====================

Next.js 15 supports file-based metadata images. To add Open Graph and Twitter images for the booked pages:

1. Create opengraph-image.png (or .jpg) in this directory
   - Recommended size: 1200x630px
   - Should include: Velto logo, rep name, "Booked: Call with [Rep Name]"
   - Use Velto Blue (#0e30db) as primary color
   - Keep it clean and professional

2. Create twitter-image.png (or .jpg) in this directory
   - Recommended size: 1200x675px (Twitter card size)
   - Similar design to OG image

Alternatively, you can generate these dynamically using the ImageResponse API in a route handler.

For now, the metadata.ts file will use default OG tags without images until these files are added.
